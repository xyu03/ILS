As for the benchmark set, we use all instances with uniform edge weights from the 11th DIMACS Implementation Challenge and 3rd PACE. 
They are divided into four datasets PUC, PUCN, SP and GAPS. 
It is known that PUC and PUCN are probably the hardest datasets for the STP problem. 
These 2 datasets are artificially constructed so that optimal solutions cannot be asily discovered by solvers, 
even the champions of the 11th DIMACS Implementation Challenge and the 3rd PACE, like PUW, CIMAT.
