### Solving uniform instance

We study an effective local search algorithm, ILS, for solving Steiner tree problem in a graph with uniform edge weights. 
The algorithm uses several strong graph reduction techniques and a novel neighborhood generation method, namely Steiner-edge-vertex swap. 
We conduct experiments on a wide range of well-known instances and confirm that our algorithm competes favorably with other state-of-the-art algorithms.
